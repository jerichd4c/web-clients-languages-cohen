# 🖥️ Web clients languages - Sebastian Cohen  🌐





## What is this repository ❓

This repository belongs to the **Web clients course** in URU for the **2025A** period, as the course progresses i will be archiving all the classes, homeworks and projects completed during the course.

## Why am i using it ❓

I am using a repository because i find it easier to store things on **GitHub**, where i can ensure that all my codes and projects are safely stored, This is preferable to storing files on a **PC** which is generally more prone to data loss due to hardware or software errors.

## Used languages and tools 👨🏻‍💻

As course title suggest, primarily frontend **markup** and **stylesheet** languages, as well as **web-development** languages will be used:
