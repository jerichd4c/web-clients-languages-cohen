# 🖥️ Web clients languages - Sebastian Cohen  🌐





## What is this repository ❓

This repository belongs to the **Web clients course** in URU for the **2025A** period, as the course progresses i will be archiving all the classes, homeworks and projects completed during the course.

## Why am i using it ❓

I am using a repository because i find it easier to store things on **GitHub**, where i can ensure that all my codes and projects are safely stored, This is preferable to storing files on a **PC** which is generally more prone to data loss due to hardware or software errors.

## Used languages and tools 👨🏻‍💻

As course title suggest, primarily frontend **markup** and **stylesheet** languages, as well as **web-development** languages will be used, such as:

* **HTML (hypertext markup language)** </>

    A widely-used markup language for web development.

* **CSS (Cascading style-sheets)** 🛠️
    
    A style sheet language used for designing and styling web pages and components.

* **JS (JavaScript)** 🇯‌🇸‌

    A high-level scripting language that, when combined with CSS and HTML, becomes a powerful tool for web development.

## Important notes ⚠️

This marks the **current** end of the **README.md**, however, i will be updating both the repo as well as this file as the course continues.
